hey,
on a scale of 1 - 10, how computer savvy would you say you are?
[Heather McCarthy]
5:11pm
ah, hello! the chat crashed last night, yeah?
[You]
5:11pm
no worries, I am a horrible chatter
[Heather McCarthy]
5:11pm
depends. usually around a 8. porque?
[You]
5:12pm
I have an app I just put out, I have the basics down and I want a non programmer to give me feedback
[Heather McCarthy]
5:12pm
ah, well i am good at that
[You]
5:12pm
I think I have to add a video explaining it a bit more too
the site is teicklesofchange.com
oops
www.tricklesofchange.com
[Heather McCarthy]
5:13pm
okay, heh, you sure it's not ticklesofchange.com? :):)
[You]
5:14pm
haha! smart a$$ :-p:-p
that doesn't exist :-p:-p
[Heather McCarthy]
5:15pm
hehe
[You]
5:18pm
so what I am concerned about is this, does it make sense before you sign up?
and then again, does it talk to you?
[Heather McCarthy]
5:19pm
hmm, well, i'm still reading the how it works page.
[You]
5:19pm
yes ma'am
oh...first impression?
[Heather McCarthy]
5:21pm
not too shabby! i know a lot of people that could use some budgeting help
[You]
5:22pm
yeah, me included
hehe
ok, lemme know what you think after you read...too verbose, doesn't make sense...etc etc
[Heather McCarthy]
5:23pm
k
alright, i think i get it.
you enter an amount for daily allotment
you set up accounts for out of the norm expenditures
and what you don't spend goes towards your stash
so its a tool to help people visualize and budget to be financially comfortable
[You]
5:30pm
close....ok, you get your check and pay your bills, put money in your savings right? and then you have this money that's left over, you have a concert you want to go for, a gift you need to buy, etc etc.
[Heather McCarthy]
5:31pm
i think there may be a lack of information regarding coming up with a daily allowance, like the basic calculation of total income minus bills, food, fuel. This is strictly for whats left over from that, right?
[You]
5:31pm
yep, that's how it is supposed to be
[Heather McCarthy]
5:32pm
are you planning on incorporating the calculation tool on your app site?
[You]
5:32pm
people tend to spend first and starve later, I want them to spend less and meet all their goals, if they can
that came up today, I will add than in a bit
the calculation tool
[Heather McCarthy]
5:33pm
coolness
how do you plan on making money off this?
[You]
5:34pm
haha!! Everyone asks me that. I just want to help folks feel rich
[Heather McCarthy]
5:34pm
so it's a free app? the humanitarian in me is very pleased.
[You]
5:35pm
hahaha! Always free
I just NEED to communicate it to folks so that understand it...if it is not beneficial, it helps me none
I would LOVE to have like 1000 people peeling their eyes out, trying to see if they meet their goals
did the accounts part make sense?
yeah, I have to add a calculator on there...tomorrows task...is there anything else you think I should add?
[Heather McCarthy]
5:37pm
sure did! and you could social network with the facebook and twitter links, get your users to see others goals, maybe so that they don't feel so alone
hmm, besides the calculator, how about a feature where you get a little audio clip of a happy piggy when you 'save' some money? ;);)
or a feature that lets you check off goals, some people really do well with a visual or audio stimulation when they have accomplished a goal
[You]
5:39pm
ok, cool.
I am going to add the facebook stuuf
and probably twitter
but I don't want to add that stuff untill the site makes a lot of sense
[Heather McCarthy]
5:40pm
I think the FAQ page is your best explanation
[You]
5:40pm
I want people to see it once and say, I get this, I am joining
going to add the calculator
then add a vid tutorial
[Heather McCarthy]
5:41pm
an animation?
[You]
5:41pm
screen capture
[Heather McCarthy]
5:42pm
ah
[You]
5:42pm
this is how you set your account up, this is how you determine your daily bank, this is what happens, this is how the chart makes sense...etc etc
I want to capture folks
[Heather McCarthy]
5:43pm
imagine if you could make it into some sort of game, and the reward is truly a reward!
like those silly farmville games or whatever
but way more simple
[You]
5:43pm
oooohhhhhhh!! I LIKE that!!
BTW: What would make you sign up?
like if you just went to the site after following a "like"
[Heather McCarthy]
5:44pm
like a status report that people can post on their facebook page or whatever that says "so and so just completed their first account goal!"
you mean if I saw someone else 'liked' it?
[You]
5:45pm
yep, if you saw someone liked it and you went to the site, what would you need to grab you?
[Heather McCarthy]
5:45pm
honestly, knowing that it was free.
[You]
5:46pm
o....yikes! need to add that on there
[Heather McCarthy]
5:46pm
FREE FREE FREE!
[You]
5:46pm
i don't use anything not free, so I didn't think about it
[Heather McCarthy]
5:47pm
i think chris would get a kick out of seeing this, once i sign up i'll show him
[You]
5:48pm
OK, please don't be shy about the feedback, I really want people to be empowered by this
[Heather McCarthy]
5:48pm
just let me know when you go live and i will sign up!
no prob, i'll let you know if i think of anything or notice anything. i think you just gotta go for it and fine tune it as it develops
[You]
5:49pm
it's live now, i just haven't advertised coz I want to make sure that I can maintain peoples attention when they hit the site
stealth live
[Heather McCarthy]
5:50pm
haha
[You]
5:50pm
does the BETA detour, I got 60 hits off facebook and not one signup...mwahaha!
[Heather McCarthy]
5:51pm
oh, er, i misread the invitation request text
it does say to sign up, but how long until you accept new users?
[You]
5:51pm
ah-ha!!!!
That's it!!!
I keep forgetting how people think. I said private BETA, so no one wants to sign up and get rejected to the party
hahaha!
[Heather McCarthy]
5:52pm
and i'm not so sure about the font of "turning drops of change into stacks of cash..." what was your idea behind that?
yep, that's a deterrent.
[You]
5:53pm
oh...umm...it was midnight
[Heather McCarthy]
5:53pm
you're just too cool for school, rubbish! Now you need to send out "private" invites to peeps who are interested on FB
then they feel extra super special. and let them know they can special invite some of their friends too. like how gmail started.
[You]
5:54pm
oooohhhhh...NICE!
NICE!!!
Who, if I loved you before, it was nothing compared to what I feel now, mwahahaha!
[Heather McCarthy]
5:55pm
;);)
[You]
5:56pm
it is all about the marketing
[Heather McCarthy]
5:57pm
yes sir. if people feel like they are special and unique, your app will prosper
i gotta run, work time!
lovely idea for the app, i'll sign up before i go
[You]
5:58pm
may I ping you later on in the week? I am going to add a vid to it and make sure it is 100% grab-able, then I'll make it public public
thanks Heather!! You have helped a bunch...talk to you later
[Heather McCarthy]
5:58pm
yep yep, sounds great!
ciao friend!!
